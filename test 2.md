### Chapter 1: Operations and Productivity

**1. Overview of Operations Management (OM)**
- **Operations Management** involves activities related to the production of goods and services.
- OM is essential in both service and manufacturing organizations.
- Organization charts illustrate OM activities across different types of organizations, such as airlines and manufacturing firms.

**2. The Supply Chain**
- **Supply Chain** is a global network of organizations and activities supplying goods and services to a firm.
- It includes all stages from raw material providers to the final customer.
- Example: The supply chain for a bottle of Coke involves farmers, syrup producers, bottlers, distributors, and retailers.

**3. Career Opportunities in OM**
- Career paths in OM include roles in technology/methods, facilities/space utilization, strategic issues, response time, team development, customer service, quality, cost reduction, inventory reduction, and productivity improvement.

**4. Differences between Goods and Services**
- **Goods** are tangible, can be inventoried, and typically have low customer interaction.
- **Services** are intangible, produced and consumed simultaneously, often dispersed, and involve high customer interaction.

**5. Employment in Manufacturing and Services**
- The U.S. labor market shows a significant shift from agriculture and manufacturing to services.

**6. New Challenges in OM**
- OM faces challenges like global focus, sustainability, supply chain partnering, rapid product development, mass customization, and lean operations.

**7. The Economic System**
- The economic system transforms inputs (e.g., labor, materials, capital) into outputs (goods/services) through a feedback loop that evaluates performance and customer satisfaction.

**8. Productivity**
- **Productivity** is a measure of efficiency, calculated as the ratio of units produced to input used.
- **Multi-factor Productivity** considers multiple resource inputs (labor, material, energy, capital) in its calculation.

**9. Productivity Variables**
- **Critical Variables** in enhancing productivity include management, labor, and capital.

**10. Key Variables for Improved Labor Productivity**
- **Basic Education**: Ensuring the workforce has appropriate education.
- **Diet**: Proper nutrition for the workforce.
- **Social Overhead**: Infrastructure and support services that make labor available.
- Maintaining and enhancing skills amidst rapidly changing technology and knowledge is crucial.

**11. Service Productivity**
- Characteristics of service productivity include labor intensiveness, focus on unique individual attributes or desires, intellectual tasks performed by professionals, difficulty in mechanization and automation, and challenges in quality evaluation.

This chapter sets the foundation for understanding the key concepts in operations management, focusing on the differences between goods and services, the significance of the supply chain, productivity measurements, and the challenges faced in the modern economic environment.

### Canada’s Lagging Productivity Will Take Years to Remedy

**Key Points:**

**1. Introduction:**
- Canada’s productivity is falling behind other developed countries, despite new investments like the Volkswagen automotive battery factory in St. Thomas, Ontario.

### Key Concepts

#### What Is Forecasting?
- **Forecasting**: Process of predicting a future event.
  - Used for decisions in production, inventory, personnel, and facilities.

---

### Forecasting Time Horizons (LO1)
1. **Short-range forecast**:
   - Up to 1 year, generally less than 3 months.
   - Examples: Purchasing, job scheduling, workforce levels, job assignments, production levels.
   
2. **Medium-range forecast**:
   - 3 months to 3 years.
   - Examples: Sales and production planning, budgeting.
   
3. **Long-range forecast**:
   - 3+ years.
   - Examples: New product planning, facility location, research and development.

**Distinguishing Differences**:
- Medium/long-range forecasts are more comprehensive and support management decisions.
- Short-term forecasts employ different methodologies and tend to be more accurate.

---

### The Realities
- Forecasts are seldom perfect.
- Most techniques assume an underlying stability in the system.
- Product family and aggregated forecasts are more accurate than individual product forecasts.

---

### Strategic Importance of Forecasting
- **Human Resources**: Planning labor needs.
- **Capacity**: Planning for equipment and facilities.
- **Supply-Chain Management**: Planning raw materials and logistics.

---

### Seven Steps in the Forecasting System
1. Determine the use of the forecast.
2. Select the items to be forecasted.
3. Determine the time horizon of the forecast.
4. Select the forecasting model(s).
5. Gather the data.
6. Make the forecast.
7. Validate and implement results.

---

### Forecasting Approaches

#### Qualitative Approaches
1. **Jury of executive opinion**: Pooling opinions of high-level experts.
2. **Delphi method**: Panel of experts queried iteratively.
3. **Sales force composite**: Aggregated estimates from individual salespersons.
4. **Consumer Market Survey**: Asking customers directly.

#### Quantitative Approaches
- **Time-series models**:
  - Naive approach
  - Moving averages
  - Exponential smoothing
  - Trend projection

- **Associative model**:
  - Linear regression

---

### Components of Demand
1. **Trend Component**: Persistent, overall upward or downward pattern.
2. **Seasonal Component**: Regular pattern of up and down fluctuations within a single year.
3. **Cyclical Component**: Repeating up and down movements affected by business cycles.
4. **Random Component**: Erratic, unsystematic fluctuations due to random variation or unforeseen events.

---

### Time-Series Forecasting (LO3)

#### Naive Approach
- Assumes demand in the next period is the same as demand in the most recent period.
  - Example: If January sales were 68, then February sales will be 68.

#### Moving Average Method
- Series of arithmetic means, used if little or no trend.
  - **Formula**: \[
  \text{Moving average} = \frac{\sum \text{Demand in previous } n \text{ periods}}{n}
  \]

#### Weighted Moving Average
- Used when some trend might be present, older data is usually less important.
  - **Formula**: \[
  \text{Weighted moving average} = \frac{\sum (\text{Weight for period } n \times \text{Demand in period } n)}{\sum \text{Weights}}
  \]

#### Exponential Smoothing
- Form of weighted moving average, weights decline exponentially, most recent data weighted most.
  - **Requires smoothing constant** (α) ranging from 0 to 1.

---

### Measures of Forecast Accuracy (LO4)

#### 1. Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
  - **Formula**: \[
    \text{MAD} = \frac{\sum \left| \text{Actual} - \text{Forecast} \right|}{n}
    \]

#### 2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - **Formula**: \[
    \text{MSE} = \frac{\sum (\text{Forecast errors})^2}{n}
    \]

#### 3. Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE)
  - **Formula**: \[
    \text{MAPE} = \frac{100}{n} \sum \left| \frac{\text{Actual} - \text{Forecast}}{\text{Actual}} \right|
    \]

---

### Seasonal Forecast Calculation
1. Find average historical demand for each season.
2. Compute the average demand over all seasons.
3. Compute a seasonal index for each season.
4. Estimate next year's total demand.
5. Divide this estimate of total demand by the number of seasons, then multiply it by the seasonal index for that season.
